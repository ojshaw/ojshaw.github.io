Here you will find resources that I've found useful when exploring into new technologies and frameworks -- I'll do my best to keep this updated and organized.

+ [Dave Wakeman's Resources for Cloud Developers](cloud4developers.github.io) is useful for technologies like Watson, Blockchain, and the IBM Cloud. There are a LOT of resources here. 

+ [Introduction to Distributed Systems](https://hackernoon.com/a-thorough-introduction-to-distributed-systems-3b91562c9b3c) I like this piece a lot, its a decent intro to distributed systems. Good if you need a refresher.
