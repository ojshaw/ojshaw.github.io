Octavia is a programmer, amateur cook, hiking & biking enthusiast, horror fan, and compulsive researcher. 

She is currently interested in blockchain, creating food that tastes good and manages not to aggravate her food sensitivities, AI technologies (currently looking at chess AIs), and much more. Shoot her an email (see footer) about something -- she is honestly always excited to learn something new.
