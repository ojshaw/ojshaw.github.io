Hello!

Welcome to my website. I've made a few websites in the past, but most of them are no longer up. The personal ones I wasn't very good at keeping updated. I would become distracted by other pursuits and would then find that I'd need to dedicate a whole day just to updating my website (which admittedly had I paid more attention to it I could have avoided that scenario). But now there's github pages (yea, I know, its been here a while -- I was taking my time) and since I already use github for everything else it seems like the perfect way to keep everything updated and display my work. 

Right now all thats here is the bare bones basic jekyll theme (a suitable placeholder for me until I finish a design that is more me) and this post. But soon I hope to have some applications and projects that I've been working on as well as the occasional blog post. 

Til then,

Octavia
